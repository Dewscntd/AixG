# Istio Alert Runbook

This runbook provides guidance for responding to alerts related to the Istio service mesh.

## High HTTP Error Rate

**Alert Name:** `HighHTTPErrorRate`

**Description:** More than 5% of HTTP requests are failing within a specific namespace.

**Severity:** Critical

**Possible Causes:**
- Service overload or resource exhaustion.
- Upstream service dependencies failing.
- Incorrect service configuration or deployment issues.
- Network connectivity problems within the mesh.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Check Grafana Dashboard:** Navigate to the Istio Service Mesh dashboard in Grafana to identify the affected service and namespace. Look for spikes in 5xx errors.
2. **Inspect Service Logs:** Use `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod-name>` to check the logs of the affected service's pods for error messages or exceptions.
3. **Check Istio Proxy Status:** Verify the status of the Istio sidecar proxy for the affected pods: `istioctl proxy-status <pod-name> -n <namespace>`.
4. **Review Recent Deployments:** Check for any recent deployments or configuration changes to the affected service or its dependencies that might have introduced issues.
5. **Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, and network utilization of the affected pods and nodes using Prometheus/Grafana to identify resource bottlenecks.
6. **Check Upstream Services:** If the service depends on other services, verify their health and performance.

**Resolution:**
- **Rollback:** If a recent deployment is suspected, consider rolling back to a previous stable version.
- **Scale Up:** Increase the number of replicas for the affected service if it's under heavy load.
- **Resource Adjustment:** Adjust resource limits and requests for the service's pods if resource exhaustion is observed.
- **Configuration Review:** Correct any misconfigurations in Istio VirtualServices, DestinationRules, or Gateway resources.
- **Network Troubleshooting:** Investigate network policies or CNI issues if connectivity is suspected.

## Latency Increase

**Alert Name:** `LatencyIncrease`

**Description:** The 99th percentile of request duration has increased significantly.

**Severity:** Warning

**Possible Causes:**
- Increased load on the service.
- Database or external dependency slowdowns.
- Inefficient code or resource contention within the service.
- Network latency within the cluster or to external services.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Check Grafana Dashboard:** Examine the Istio Service Mesh dashboard for latency trends and identify the specific service experiencing increased latency.
2. **Identify Bottleneck:** Use distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, if integrated) to pinpoint the exact component or operation causing the latency.
3. **Dependency Health:** Verify the health and performance of all downstream dependencies (databases, caches, other microservices).
4. **Resource Utilization:** Check resource metrics (CPU, memory, I/O) for the affected service's pods and underlying nodes.
5. **Database Query Performance:** If a database is involved, analyze slow queries or connection pool issues.

**Resolution:**
- **Optimize Code/Queries:** Identify and optimize inefficient code paths or database queries.
- **Scale Out/Up:** Increase the number of service replicas or allocate more resources to existing pods.
- **Caching:** Implement or optimize caching strategies to reduce load on backend systems.
- **Load Balancing:** Review Istio load balancing configurations for optimal distribution.
- **Database Optimization:** Work with database administrators to address performance issues.

## General Steps for Any Alert

1. **Acknowledge the Alert:** Acknowledge the alert in your monitoring system (e.g., Alertmanager UI) to prevent repeated notifications.
2. **Communicate:** Inform relevant team members about the ongoing incident and its status.
3. **Document:** Record all troubleshooting steps, findings, and resolutions in an incident management system or a dedicated log.
4. **Post-Mortem:** After resolution, conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand the root cause, prevent recurrence, and identify areas for improvement.
